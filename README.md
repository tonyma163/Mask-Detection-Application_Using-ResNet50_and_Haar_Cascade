# Mask Detection Application (Using ResNet50 & Haar Cascade)
Author: Ma Man To Tony

It is my school project LMAO

Using colab to build a mask detection application.

Using ResNet50 and Haar Cascade

Using around a month to build this -.- (my first machine learning project)

Application Flow:
1. Using the ResNet50 to train classifying a face is wearing a mask or not
2. Using the colab given code to create the webcam capturing function
3. Using the Haar Cascade to detect the webcam captured photo
4. Using the trained ResNet50 model to predict the captured photo result

Limitations:
1. It only detect one face in the photo.
2. The Haar Cascade is not very accurate
3. The ResNet50 model cannot classify the human are wearing mask wrongly because the sample is not enough

(More introduction of the application is in the ppt)
